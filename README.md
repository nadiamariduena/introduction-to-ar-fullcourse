#### Introduction to <u>Extended Reality</u>

> Extended Reality contains 3 subdomains(children):

- Augmented Reality

- Virtual Reaƒ∫ity

- Mixed Reality

<br>
 
## Augmented Reality ü¶ñ

> Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including: **visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.**

- Examples: Pokemon GO, ARLoopa, Ikea Place.

### Types of Augmented Reality

<br>

##### Marker-Based Augmented Reality

##### Marker-Less Augmented Reality

- Super Imposition AR

- Location Based AR

- Projection Based AR

- Outlining AR

> **This type of AR** works on the concept of tracking and recognition. In this type of AR you need to have a marker through which you could perform the augmentation.

**In general this augments Digital Objects upon a marker.** (the marger is the img icon on the center of the leaf, it can also be a QR code )
