> Every year we get more and more signs for just how big the **augmented reality (AR) market** is going to be within the next few years. Whether these signs are Apple‚Äôs AR hiring spree, increasing needs in maintenance scenarios, or vague hints from Facebook founders, we‚Äôre catching wind of them.

According to major players such as one of the most popular interactive development platforms, Unity3D, AR revenue is expected to surpass VR revenue. Given that every modern smartphone is an AR device by default, these major players are probably right.

<br>

The AR market was worth around 3,5 billion in 2017 and it is estimated to reach a mighty $198 billion by 2025. Building and virtual content and designing new AR experiences of the future sounds like a safe bet!

<br>

#### The question is: ‚ÄúWhen will you start developing AR applications yourself?‚Äù

**If the answer is ‚Äúnow,‚Äù** which it should be, the next question is \*\*‚ÄúWhat tools should we use?‚Äù\*\* or before that "what software is used for augmented reality" anyway?

Well, this is exactly the question this guide answers.

<br>

> **The AR development industry** is highly competitive with major tech companies amply investing into their own AR software development kits (SDK). **Apple** released their <u>ARKit</u> back in 2017, and just one year later **Google** presented <u>ARCore</u> . **There are 4** major AR SDKs today: <br> <br> **ARKit, ARCore, Vuforia and AR Foundation**. üå§Ô∏è <br> <br> <u>All SDKs are integrated in Unity game engine (make sure you have the last version of Unity)</u> and Unreal Engine 4.

### ARCore vs ARKit

> Put simply, ARCore is Google's answer to Apple's ARKit. It's a development platform for creating augmented reality applications that was released in early 2018. The SDK run on Google Play Services for AR and you'll have to agree to its terms and conditions before you download the tool for development.
