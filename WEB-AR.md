### What Web AR means (Augmented Reality on the Web)

- Augmented Reality is the technology that makes possible to overlay content on the real world. It can be provided for several type of devices: handheld (like mobile phones), headsets, desktop displays, and so on.

<br>

**For handheld devices (more generally, for video-see-through devices) the 'reality' is captured from one or more cameras and then shown on the device display, adding some kind of content on top of it.**

<br>

#### For developers, to develop Augmented Reality ('AR' from now on) on the Web, means to avoid all the Mobile app development efforts and costs related to App stores (validation, time to publish). It also means to re-use well known technologies like Javascript, HTML and CSS, familiar to a lot of developers and possibly designers.

## Why AR.js

<br>

We believe in the Web, as a collaborative and accessible environment. We also believe in Augmented Reality technology, as a new communication medium, that can help people see reality in new, exciting ways. **We see Augmented Reality (AR) used everyday for a lot of useful applications, from art, to education, also for fun.**

We strongly believe that such a powerful technology, that can help people and leverage their creativity, should be free in some way. Also collaborative, if possible. And so, we continue the work started by Jerome Etienne, in bringing AR on the Web, as a free and Open Source technology.

Thank you for being interested in this, if you'd like to collaborate in any way, contact us (https://twitter.com/nicolocarp).

The project is now under a Github organization, that you can find at https://github.com/ar-js-org and you can ask to be part of it, for free.
